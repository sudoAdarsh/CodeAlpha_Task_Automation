# 1. Superman 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.1 (361K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 9m 
* **Content Rating:** PG-13 
* **Description:** When Superman was released this summer, Kal-El faced an uphill battle in fictional Metropolis as well as at the real-world box office. By most measurements, however, the first movie in James Gunn's DC Universe qualified as a hit. The franchise reboot had to shoulder some heavy lifting: introducing a new Clark Kent and battling a force stronger than Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor -- the movie-going public's increased superhero apathy. But Superman topped our charts for the first two weeks of its global release and returned to the top 10 in September as it hit streaming. Soon after notching more than $600 million worldwide, a sequel, Man of Tomorrow, jumped the DC Universe production line and landed a July 2027 release date, with David Corenswet back as the red-blue blur.
# 2. Weapons 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.5 (260K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 8m 
* **Content Rating:** R 
* **Description:** In a great year for original horror, Weapons stood out from the pack with its compelling mystery, unique story structure, and striking visuals. The low-budget thrill fest was an instant hit upon its August release, blowing past initial box office projections and grossing $100 million in just two weeks. Amy Madigan and the cast gave transformative performances, while puzzling symbols like the floating assault rifle left audiences with lots to digest after the credits rolled. But it's the cultural impact that's really significant here. From Gladys memes to the newly coined term “Weapons-run,” director Zach Cregger's sophomore horror movie has transcended film to become a living piece of pop culture.
# 3. Sinners 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.6 (324K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 17m 
* **Content Rating:** R 
* **Description:** Ryan Coogler's supernatural epic, blending Delta Blues lore, vampire mythology, and a deeply personal tribute to his late uncle, shattered box office records to become both the fifth highest-grossing horror film of all time and one of 2025's top domestic releases. IMDb fans definitely took notice, landing the genre-bending horror film into the IMDb MOVIEmeter's top 20 for three months. With anticipated 2026 Oscars nominations across major categories including Best Picture, Best Director, and Original Screenplay, we can't wait to see this groundbreaking film shatter more records come awards season.
# 4. One Battle After Another 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.9 (198K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 41m 
* **Content Rating:** R 
* **Description:** Paul Thomas Anderson's tenth film had a theatrical run with as many highs and lows as the movie itself. The near three-hour epic about revolution and resistance in the face of systemic oppression was a critical hit, with reviewers praising everything from the timely script to the rollercoaster ride of a third act car chase. IMDb fans took to the search bar to check out the star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio as the rebel-turned-stoner forced back into the field to save his kidnapped daughter. And yet, due to a heavy price tag, One Battle will likely lose money, even as it became the best opening for an Anderson film, taking in $22 million on its first weekend.
# 5. Jurassic World: Rebirth 
* **IMDb Rating:** 5.9 (161K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 13m 
* **Content Rating:** PG-13 
* **Description:** After two Jurassic trilogies, executive producer Steven Spielberg tapped original Jurassic Park and The Lost World screenwriter David Koepp to create a standalone sequel with a new set of characters, including dino-fanatic Scarlett Johansson, who has dreamed of joining the franchise for a decade. With director Gareth Edwards (The Creator, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) at the helm, Rebirth was an unqualified hit, renewing fan interest while surpassing box office projections with $870 million worldwide.
# 6. Frankenstein 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.5 (185K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 29m 
* **Content Rating:** R 
* **Description:** Guillermo del Toro's childhood dream came to life this year. You could barely find it in theaters, but Frankenstein became a cultural phenom as it hit Netflix in early November, and the film has shown little interest in vacating its position near the top of IMDb's MOVIEmeter chart. As the Creature, Jacob Elordi literally towered over del Toro's tale, a Gothic story of forgiveness that completely whammied viewers as Victor Frankenstein and his creation went way off book in the film's final act.
# 7. Happy Gilmore 2 
* **IMDb Rating:** 6.1 (106K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 1h 54m 
* **Content Rating:** PG-13 
* **Description:** In retrospect, this was an easy putt to sink. Capitalize on ‘90s nostalgia with a sequel to one of Adam Sandler's most iconic movies and put it on the era's most dominant and ubiquitous streaming platform. But Netflix and the Sandman didn't phone it in, overdelivering with a non-stop stream of cameos and gags that broke streaming records with almost 3 billion minutes watched in the U.S. in its first week alone.
# 8. Thunderbolts* 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.1 (247K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 7m 
* **Content Rating:** PG-13 
* **Description:** Back when we didn't know what the * meant, the Thunderbolts were a depressed band of superheroes who, to some audiences, felt assembled to plug a hole in Marvel's theatrical release calendar. Sure, it wasn't a right decision to keep the movie's Avengers connection under wraps while trying to hype a little-known MCU collective, but Florence Pugh and company eked out a few victories: the people who saw the film tended to like/love it, critical reviews were even more favorable, it notched a spot on our Best Of 2025 list, and it's certain more people will be familiar with Yelena Belova and her crew when Avengers: Doomsday is released next December.
# 9. Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.2 (192K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 49m 
* **Content Rating:** PG-13 
* **Description:** For literal decades now, audiences have been heading to the theater to watch Tom Cruise execute the most insane stunts ever captured on film. This time around, the Hollywood legend filmed in an 8.5-million-liter water tank while breathing his own carbon dioxide before hanging from a 1930s Boeing Stearman biplane at 10,000 feet going 120 miles an hour. Not a bad way to bid adieu to the action franchise that has helped keep Cruise a household name for 30 years. And while The Final Reckoning was the first film in the franchise to not win its opening weekend box office, it still contributed to box office history as part of the largest domestic Memorial Day weekend with a combined $334.5 million.
# 10. F1: The Movie 
* **IMDb Rating:** 7.7 (253K) 
* **Type:** Movie 
* **Duration:** 2h 35m 
* **Content Rating:** PG-13 
* **Description:** Brad Pitt and Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski delivered Apple its first major box office hit this year (to the tune of $641 million globally) after a string of expensive duds. The recipe? Start with a bona fide movie star, sprinkle in some nerve-throttling racing scenes in IMAX, and add some top-notch supporting talent, including Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, and fresh face Damson Idris. As a former Formula One driver returning to the sport, Pitt has a blast leaning into the weathered veteran persona that earned him an Oscar in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
